            Makingautoeasy wants to make the car buying process easier for users by providing a simplified way to evaluate 10 vehicles that match their needs. To achieve this, it is important to identify the key factors that would impact the user's decision-making process, such as cargo space, fuel economy, and dimensions. To showcase details and features, the best approach would be to provide a clear and concise overview of each vehicle, highlighting the key features that are important to the user.

      <h2>Problem Analysis</h2>
      <p>The objective of the design challenge is to enhance the design of the individual car page, which assists users in obtaining a better understanding of the car they are searching for. The aim is to provide users with a straightforward and comprehensible summary of the key features of their preferred vehicle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h2>My Solution</h2>
      <p>To address these problems, the UI is redesigned to improve consistency, simplify the interface, and make
        better use of space. Specifically, background colors were added to distinguish content types, and certain
        features were made collapsible.</p>

      <p>After evaluating the old design, I conducted research and discovered that competitor vehicle pages contained a significant amount of data. To simplify the car buying process for customers, I made the decision to eliminate scrollability and instead provide a clear and concise overview of important information regarding each vehicle on a single screen.
        To improve user experience, a Call-to-action was added to the navigation bar, allowing customers to easily create a custom-built list of vehicles that meet their needs. A toggle button was also included at the top left to switch between interior and exterior views of the vehicle, while arrows on the sides of the vehicle images allow for easy navigation between different views.
        The ability to switch between different vehicle colors is located below the vehicle image, with the three main features of the vehicle displayed alongside. On the right side at the top is an "About" section, followed by a pros and cons comparison of the vehicle. Underneath this comparison, a table with a toggle option is available, allowing customers to switch between price, economy, and dimensions. These enhancements aim to provide customers with a more user-friendly experience that facilitates informed decision-making during the car buying process.</p>
