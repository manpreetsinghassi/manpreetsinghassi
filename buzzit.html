      </div>
      <p><span>1</span>I noticed that the login button in the navigation bar was somewhat obscured between the "Sign up" and "Join event" buttons. To address this issue, I chose to consolidate the "Sign up" and "Join event" buttons, making the login button more visible and accessible.</p>
      <p><span>2</span>I observed that the description and intro video in the hero section were overlapping on top of each other. To enhance the design layout, I decided to rearrange them to appear in front of one another.</p>
      <p><span>3</span>In order to improve the user experience of the features section, I made a couple of adjustments. Firstly, I removed the signup button as it was already appearing repetitively in the sticky navbar, reducing clutter and redundancy. Secondly, I restructured the layout of the second feature by swapping the positions of its description and relevant picture. This change helped to create a clearer hierarchy and emphasized the visual impact of the features.</p>
      <p><span>4</span>To enhance the visual appeal of the cards, I opted for a white color scheme and rounded the borders. To make them stand out, I also added a subtle box shadow effect. Additionally, I removed the signup buttons from the cards to reduce unnecessary repetition and clutter, allowing the user to focus on the key content.</p>
      <p><span>5</span>I made the decision to move the happy customers section further down the homepage to ensure that users first become familiar with the core purpose and target audience of Buzzit. To enhance the visual appeal of the customer testimonials, I created three separate cards, each featuring a description of how Buzzit is making customers happy. These cards were designed with a border, box shadow, and a light yellow color palette to make them stand out and draw attention to the positive experiences of past customers.</p>
      <p><span>6</span>I redesigned the cards in the testimonials section to maintain a consistent design throughout the homepage. Additionally, I slightly decreased the size of the cards to make the content look more organized and easier to read.</p>
      <p><span>7</span>To maintain a consistent design across the homepage, I made the decision to create the cards in these sections using the same style as the others. In addition, I removed the section below to avoid repetition of content, which included a signup form and an introductory video that were already present on the homepage.</p>
      <p><span>8</span>I redesigned the footer section by combining the hyperlinks and social media icons into a single footer, which helped save valuable space on the homepage.</p>

        <p>I have opted to remove the signup form to reduce clutter and instead utilize a popup window. The popup window will appear after 16 seconds, allowing the user to familiarize themselves with Buzzit before being presented with the signup option.</p>
