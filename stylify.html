                </div>
            </div>
            <p>After much consideration, our team decided to go for a logo based on a typeface. Every designer in our
                team presented 3 potential logos based on a rough sketch and we all agreed this logo to be part of our
                brand identity. It is a custom Serif typeface that has been curved more on the edges to make it stand
                out and to create a stylish look for our product “Stylify” which means “style in life”.
                <br><br>

                Behind the typeface, we have created a combination of lines that depicts the mirrors in salons. Mirrors
                carry great importance in hair salons as their main function is to show the customer how the stylists
                are doing their job and they can guide stylists to their desired results.
                <br><br>

                We wanted to create a logo that is unique so first-time users could get some idea about what our product
                is all about before using it.

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Our reason behind choosing this color palette is that we wanted to stand out from our competition. It is
                an application specifically for salons and beauty-related businesses. We wanted to create the same kind
                of atmosphere here in our design as their businesses and after considering a lot of other color
                combinations, this is our final color palette which I believe works well with our design choice inspired
                by neo-brutalism and neo-pop. This color palette suits our bold choice of design and we have two
                functional colors for success and error in input fields. This color choice passes all the contrast
                checkers and makes us different from our competitors.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>To fit our bold design we wanted to use a combination of Playfair Display(Serif) and Figtree(Sans-serif)
                typefaces. Serif font is used to match the style and classiness of our application and sans-serif font
                is for good readability for the user. I believe these typefaces match our application perfectly because
                we needed something with more font families for different parts of our application and we didn’t want to
                have more than 2 fonts as it might be overwhelming for the user.</p>

                As part of my responsibilities, I designed a responsive landing page for the Stylify website, which
                involved creating wireframes and mockups. To ensure consistency between the mobile app and the landing
                page, I applied the style direction to achieve a seamless design. The landing page serves as an
                introduction to Stylify's main features and team members.
