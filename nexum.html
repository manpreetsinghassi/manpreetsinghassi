                    Nexum is a platform designed to connect post-secondary students and alumni, providing
                    valuable networking opportunities to help students succeed in their job search. By collecting data
                    on graduates, such as their employment status, companies they work for, and other relevant
                    information, post-secondary institutions can use Nexum to promote their programs and demonstrate the
                    success of their alumni. When a post-secondary institution offers the Nexum platform to its
                    students, it signals a commitment to their success and provides access to a vast network of profiles
                    from others who have completed the same program, creating new possibilities for future career
                    growth.

            <p>As a member of a team that included four designers and three developers, I played a leadership role in
                various aspects of the project. Specifically, I led the development of mockups, conducted user
                interviews and testing, created prototypes and social media assets, and assisted with identifying the
                target audience, developing user flows, and crafting the project proposal. Overall, our team worked
                collaboratively to bring this project to life, leveraging our diverse skill sets and expertise to
                deliver a successful outcome.</p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
                For many students, finding a job in their field after completing their studies is a top concern. Before
                choosing a post-secondary program, students conduct extensive research on institutions to ensure that
                they will receive a valuable education that leads to meaningful employment opportunities. Critical
                questions include: Will I be able to find a job after completing this program? How many individuals have
                graduated from this program, and how many are currently working in the industry? These questions are
                paramount for students, who not only invest their financial resources in their education, but also their
                valuable time and effort.
                To help make this decision easier and support students in their job search, we created Nexum. This
                powerful platform connects post-secondary students and alumni, providing a vast network of resources and
                opportunities to help them succeed in their chosen field. By leveraging data and insights on graduates,
                Nexum helps students make informed decisions about their post-secondary education and achieve their
                professional goals with greater ease.

                <p>Our logo design for "Nexum" incorporates multiple meaningful elements. The name "Nexum" derives from
                    the Latin word for nexus, connection, and links, which is why we chose the most widely recognized
                    icon for links as a central component of the logo. By intertwining this icon to form an "X," which
                    is part of the word Nexum, we created a dynamic and memorable logo that conveys a sense of
                    connection and unity.


                    <br><br>

                    In selecting the colors for our logo, we carefully considered the diverse cultural backgrounds of
                    our users. The colors we chose reflect these differences and symbolize the importance of bringing
                    people together.
                    <br><br>

                    To ensure the logo is modern and minimalist, we chose the Quicksand typeface, which has rounded
                    corners that complement the icon in the logo. Its sans-serif design also enhances legibility and
                    ensures the logo is easily recognizable and readable. Overall, our logo embodies the spirit of Nexum
                    and represents our commitment to creating meaningful connections among our users.

                    is
                    an application specifically for salons and beauty-related businesses. We wanted to create the same
                    kind
                    of atmosphere here in our design as their businesses and after considering a lot of other color
                    combinations, this is our final color palette which I believe works well with our design choice
                    inspired
                    by neo-brutalism and neo-pop. This color palette suits our bold choice of design and we have two
                    functional colors for success and error in input fields. This color choice passes all the contrast
                    checkers and makes us different from our competitors.</p> -->
