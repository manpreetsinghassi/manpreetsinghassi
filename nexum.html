                    Nexum is a platform designed to connect post-secondary students and alumni, providing
                    valuable networking opportunities to help students succeed in their job search. By collecting data
                    on graduates, such as their employment status, companies they work for, and other relevant
                    information, post-secondary institutions can use Nexum to promote their programs and demonstrate the
                    success of their alumni. When a post-secondary institution offers the Nexum platform to its
                    students, it signals a commitment to their success and provides access to a vast network of profiles
                    from others who have completed the same program, creating new possibilities for future career
                    growth.

            <h2>My role in the team</h2>
            <p>As a member of a team that included four designers and three developers, I played a leadership role in
                various aspects of the project. Specifically, I led the development of mockups, conducted user
                interviews and testing, created prototypes and social media assets, and assisted with identifying the
                target audience, developing user flows, and crafting the project proposal. Overall, our team worked
                collaboratively to bring this project to life, leveraging our diverse skill sets and expertise to
                deliver a successful outcome.</p>

            <h2>Problem</h2>
            <p>
                For many students, finding a job in their field after completing their studies is a top concern. Before
                choosing a post-secondary program, students conduct extensive research on institutions to ensure that
                they will receive a valuable education that leads to meaningful employment opportunities. Critical
                questions include: Will I be able to find a job after completing this program? How many individuals have
                graduated from this program, and how many are currently working in the industry? These questions are
                paramount for students, who not only invest their financial resources in their education, but also their
                valuable time and effort.
                To help make this decision easier and support students in their job search, we created Nexum. This
                powerful platform connects post-secondary students and alumni, providing a vast network of resources and
                opportunities to help them succeed in their chosen field. By leveraging data and insights on graduates,
                Nexum helps students make informed decisions about their post-secondary education and achieve their
                professional goals with greater ease.

                </div>
                <p>After much consideration, our team decided to go for a logo based on a typeface. Every designer in
                    our
                    team presented 3 potential logos based on a rough sketch and we all agreed this logo to be part of
                    our
                    brand identity. It is a custom Serif typeface that has been curved more on the edges to make it
                    stand
                    out and to create a stylish look for our product “Stylify” which means “style in life”.
                    <br><br>

                    Behind the typeface, we have created a combination of lines that depicts the mirrors in salons.
                    Mirrors
                    carry great importance in hair salons as their main function is to show the customer how the
                    stylists
                    are doing their job and they can guide stylists to their desired results.
                    <br><br>

                    We wanted to create a logo that is unique so first-time users could get some idea about what our
                    product
                    is all about before using it.

                    <img src="assets/Images & Icons/Stylify/stylify-color-system.svg" alt="Image"

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Our reason behind choosing this color palette is that we wanted to stand out from our competition. It
                    is
                    an application specifically for salons and beauty-related businesses. We wanted to create the same
                    kind
                    of atmosphere here in our design as their businesses and after considering a lot of other color
                    combinations, this is our final color palette which I believe works well with our design choice
                    inspired
                    by neo-brutalism and neo-pop. This color palette suits our bold choice of design and we have two
                    functional colors for success and error in input fields. This color choice passes all the contrast
                    checkers and makes us different from our competitors.</p>

                </div>
                <p>To fit our bold design we wanted to use a combination of Playfair Display(Serif) and
                    Figtree(Sans-serif)
                    typefaces. Serif font is used to match the style and classiness of our application and sans-serif
                    font
                    is for good readability for the user. I believe these typefaces match our application perfectly
                    because
                    we needed something with more font families for different parts of our application and we didn’t
                    want to
                    have more than 2 fonts as it might be overwhelming for the user.</p>

                    page, I applied the style direction to achieve a seamless design. The landing page serves as an
