        <p>
          SoundCloud is an online audio platform that allows users to upload, promote, and share their music, podcasts,
          and other audio recordings with a global audience. The platform features a vast collection of tracks, ranging
          from original compositions by independent artists to remixes and cover versions of popular songs. This case
          study focused on the app's UI and some improvement to the UX.

      <h2>Problem Analysis</h2>
      <p>The existing SoundCloud UI suffered from issues with consistency, clutter, and user experience. The interface
        did not make optimal use of available screen space, resulting in a suboptimal user experience."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="solution">
      <h2>My Solution</h2>
      <p>To address these problems, the UI was redesigned to improve consistency, simplify the interface, and make
        better use of space. Specifically, background colors were added to distinguish content types, and certain
        features were made collapsible.</p>

      <p><span>1</span> The navbar has been improved to enhance readability and user experience. The height has been increased, and the Go+/Next Pro buttons have been relocated to the main area of the webpage. The Upload button has been converted to an upload icon and given more padding between other buttons. The active tab will be more distinguishable with increased font weight, primary color, and a black background to indicate which tab is currently active.</p>
      <p><span>2</span>To make it easier for users to navigate between cards, a left arrow has been added, disabled until the right arrow is clicked. Once the user has reached the end of the cards, the right arrow will become disabled.</p>
      <p><span>3</span>All cards have been given a background to make it easier for users to differentiate between content. Previously, thin lines were used to separate the content, making it difficult to distinguish.</p>
      <p><span>4</span>The Go+ and Next Pro buttons have been converted into big clickable cards. Users can now see a short description of what to expect before moving to those features.</p>
      <p><span>5</span>To make the homepage less scrollable, all lists have been converted into clickable cards. When users click on a card, a list dropdown will open where they can see the songs in list form. This makes it easier for users to quickly access the content they want.</p>

      </div>
      </div>
      <p>In the mobile view of the homepage, I have focused on improving the visual design by incorporating the primary color and a grey background color for all cards. The header and footer have been updated to black, creating a bolder appearance compared to the previous white color used in the old mobile website. These changes help to enhance the overall aesthetics and improve the user experience for mobile users.</p>

      <p>To improve the user experience, I have made a single but significant change to this page - adding a distinct background color to each section. By doing so, it is easier for the user to differentiate between different sections and quickly identify the content they are looking for. This subtle but effective change helps to make the page more user-friendly and improves the overall browsing experience.</p>

      </div>
      </div>
      <p>In the mobile view of the feed page, there was a long list of artists, which could make the page difficult to navigate. To address this, I added a "View All" secondary button that allows users to expand the list of artists, making the website less scrollable overall. This design change helps to streamline the user experience and makes it easier for users to find the content they are looking for.</p>
